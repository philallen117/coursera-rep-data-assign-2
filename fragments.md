### Data source

Storm Data is an official publication of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which documents:

a. The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having
sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or
disruption to commerce;

b. Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow
flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; and

c. Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum
temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event.
