Basically, stuff I did not get working.


```{r}
# health.outcomes <- "cbind(FATALITIES, INJURIES)"
# money.outcomes <- "cbind(PROPDMG, CROPDMG)"
# outcomes.time <- as.formula(paste0(outcomes," ~ year(BGN_DATE)"))
# sums.time <- aggregate(outcomes.time, data = try2, FUN = sum)
# health.outcomes.type <- as.formula(paste0(outcomes," ~ EVTYPE"))
# tiles.type <- aggregate(FATALITIES ~ EVTYPE, data = try2, FUN = quantile, probs = (c(0.9, 0.99, 0.999))) # didn't work - try dplyr
# Try to plot several aes on same plot for different quant points with factor on x axis
# COnsider logs
# p <- qplot(decade)

# chosen <- aggregate(cbind(FATALITIES, INJURIES, PROPDMG, CROPDMG) ~ EVTYPE, 
# 					data = decade,
# 					FUN = sum)

```
